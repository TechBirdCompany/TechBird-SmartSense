001	Initial Schematic
002	Changed FRAM type to 3.3V variant
	Changed Connector for external NTCs
	Switched 3.3V reference voltage
	Switched to USB Type-C
	Added additional LEDs
	Switched battery to supercap

ToDo: 
	Consider switching ADC Type to a not differential one
	Consider adding an RGB LED for better error codes
	Route GPIOs to RTC Domain
	Replace main connector
